Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
Description: Implements fast, scalable optimization algorithms for
    fitting topic models and non-negative matrix factorizations to
    count data. The algorithms are particularly well suited to large,
    sparse count data (that is, data containing a high proportion of
    zero counts), but the algorithms also work well on non-sparse
    data.
