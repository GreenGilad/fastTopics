Description: Implements fast, scalable optimization algorithms for
    fitting topic models and non-negative matrix factorizations to
    count data. The methods exploit the close relationship between
    topic modeling and Poisson non-negative matrix factorization. The
    algorithms can acccommodate large, sparse count data (that is,
    data containing a high proportion of zero counts).
