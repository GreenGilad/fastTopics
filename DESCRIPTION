Description: Implements fast, scalable optimization algorithms for
    fitting topic models and non-negative factorizations to count data (or
    "pseudocounts"). The algorithms are particularly well suited to large,
    sparse data sets (that is, data containing a high proportion of zero
    counts), but the algorithms also work well on non-sparse data.
