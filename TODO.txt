to do
=====

+ Allow for plotting (-log10) p-values or z-scores in volcano_plot
  (that is, choose what measure of support to use). This should be
  controlled by input argument "y".

+ Implement simple *interactive* "volcano" plot using plotly
  ("volcano_plotly")

+ Add test(s) for volcano_plot and volcano_plotly.

+ Run R CMD check --as-cran and fix WARNINGs & NOTEs.

+ Implement backtracking line search option for SCD algorithm.

+ Update the pkgdown site.
  
+ Create vignette illustrating differential gene expression analyses
  on a simulated data set.

+ Create vignette giving more details about the different optimization
  algorithms. (Then simplify the fit_poisson_nmf example.)

+ Create vignette illustrating application of fastTopics to gene
  expression (single-cell RNA-seq) data, with a focus on visualizing
  the results, and implementing differential expression analysis using
  the fitted topic model.

+ Create vignette illustrating application of fastTopics to text data,
  with a focus on the different ways to visualize the results.

+ Add CITATION.
