to do
=====

+ Update the pkgdown site using the latest version of pkgdown.

+ Add info about rate of nonzeros in F and L to progress, and to
  console output when verbose = TRUE. (Nonzeros are determined
  according to some prespecified threshold in the "control" input
  argument.)

+ Add roxygen2 documentation to "fit_poisson_nmf" function.

+ Make the droplet data set smaller so that it can be used in a
  vignette.

+ In altsqp roxygen2 docs, give advice on setting control parameters.

+ Set up continuous integration (Travis CI, Appveyor, CircleCI) and
  CodeCov. (Only do this after making the package public.)

+ Fill out "Quick Start" instructions in README.

+ Fill out @details for altsqp.
