to do
=====

+ Implement function to compute estimates of term-frequency log-ratios
  (tflrs), s.e.'s and Z-scores.

+ Implement simple bar plot to show loadings vs. categorical variable
  ("loadings_plot").

+ Implement simple "volcano" plot ("volcano_plot").

+ Implement simple interactive "volcano" plot using plotly
  ("volcano_plotly")

+ Implement simple 2-d t-SNE plot to show loadings for a single topic
  projected onto a 2-d surface ("tsne_plot_2d").

+ Implement simple a "STRUCTURE" plot, in which the samples (rows) are
  automatically arranged by a 1-d t-SNE embedding ("structure_plot").
  Optionally, a categorical variable (labeling) may be provided, in
  which case the samples are arranged according to that labeling.

+ Implement backtracking line search option for SCD algorithm.

+ Update the pkgdown site.

+ Add CITATION.
