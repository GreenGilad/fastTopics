to do
=====

+ In altsqp, assess convergence by computing norm of the gradient (try
  L0, L1 and L2 norms).

+ Make the droplet data set smaller so that it can be used in a
  vignette.

+ In altsqp roxygen2 docs, give advice on setting control parameters.

+ Implement a short vignette using the droplet data; compare against
  nnmf and altsqp with numsqp = 0.

+ Make pkgdown site.

+ Set up continuous integration (Travis CI, Appveyor, CircleCI) and
  CodeCov.

+ Fill out "Quick Start" instructions in README.

+ Fill out @details for altsqp.
