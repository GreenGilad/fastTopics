to do
=====

+ Implement plot_progress_poisson_nmf.

+ Implement fit_poisson_nmf, first without extrapolation.

+ Update the pkgdown site using the latest version of pkgdown.

+ Add info about rate of nonzeros in F and L to progress, and to
  console output when verbose = TRUE. (Nonzeros are determined
  according to some prespecified threshold in the "control" input
  argument.)

+ Create an example 100 x 200 data set in the data/ directory, and
  store a (local) solution, as well as the log-likelihood and deviance
  at that solution; build on the betanmf example.

+ Add roxygen2 documentation to "fit_poisson_nmf" function.

+ In fit_topics, extract row and column names from X and use these for
  L and F.

+ Provide option in fit_poisson_nmf to automatically determine number
  of threads in multithreading.

+ Change message about "consider converting X to a sparse matrix" so
  that it is only printed when X is fairly large.

+ Add steps to fix initializations containing zeros that cause
  problems for em, mu and lda algorithms. (And print warning when
  fixing this.)

+ Implement an option to periodically "restart" the extrapolation
  scheme, as in the conjugate gradients method.

+ Add "model" argument to fit_topics, so that it can return the
  parameters for either the Poisson or multinomial topic models.

+ Make the droplet data set smaller so that it can be used in a
  vignette.

+ In altsqp roxygen2 docs, give advice on setting control parameters.

+ Implement a short vignette using the droplet data; compare against
  nnmf and altsqp with numsqp = 0.

+ Set up continuous integration (Travis CI, Appveyor, CircleCI) and
  CodeCov. (Only do this after making the package public.)

+ Fill out "Quick Start" instructions in README.

+ Fill out @details for altsqp.
