to do
=====

+ Write function to simulate a data sets for testing differential
  gene expression analysis.

+ Implement function to compute estimates of term-frequency log-ratios
  (tflrs), s.e.'s and Z-scores.

+ Implement simple "volcano" plot ("volcano_plot").

+ Implement simple *interactive* "volcano" plot using plotly
  ("volcano_plotly")

+ Implement simple 2-d t-SNE plot to show loadings for a single topic
  projected onto a 2-d surface ("tsne_plot").

+ Implement simple a "STRUCTURE" plot, in which the samples (rows) are
  automatically arranged by a 1-d t-SNE embedding ("structure_plot").
  Optionally, a categorical variable (labeling) may be provided, in
  which case the samples are arranged according to that labeling.

+ Implement backtracking line search option for SCD algorithm.

+ Update the pkgdown site.
  
+ Create vignette illustrating the "relative" and "absolute"
  differential gene expression analyses on a simulated data set.

+ Create vignette giving more details about the different optimization
  algorithms. (Then simplify the fit_poisson_nmf example.)

+ Create vignette illustrating application of fastTopics to text data,
  with a focus on the different ways to visualize the results.

+ Create vignette illustrating application of fastTopics to gene
  expression (single-cell RNA-seq) data, with a focus on the different
  ways to visualize the results.

+ Add CITATION.
