to do
=====

+ Implement options "numem" and "numsqp" in altsqp.

+ Add test verifying that altsqp gives same result as betanmf when
  numsqp = 0.

+ Learn about RcppParallel.

+ Implement multithreaded Rcpp version of altsqp updates.

+ Profile memory usage for altsqp on a large, sparse matrix; memory
  should be proportional to the number of nonzeros in the matrix.

+ Document the droplet data set.

+ Implement a short vignette using the droplet data.

+ Change the computation of max.diff so that it does not create an
  n x m dense matrix.

+ Fix log.multinom so that it does not use tcrossprod.

+ Add comments to betanmf function explaining that it is mainly used
  for testing altsqp implementation.

+ Fill out "Quick Start" instructions in README.

+ Fill out @details for altsqp.
