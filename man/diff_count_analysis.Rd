\usage{
diff_count_analysis(
  fit,
  X,
  s = rowSums(X),
  numiter = 100,
  tol = 1e-08,
  e = 1e-15,
  betamax = 10,
  shrink.method = c("ash", "none"),

  ...
)

}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class \dQuote{poisson_nmf_fit} or
\dQuote{multinom_topic_model_fit}. If a Poisson NMF fit is provided
as input, the corresponding multinomial topic model fit is
automatically recovered using \code{\link{poisson2multinom}}.}

\item{X}{The n x m counts matrix. It can be a sparse matrix (class
\code{"dgCMatrix"}) or dense matrix (class \code{"matrix"}).}

\item{s}{A numeric vector of length n determining how the rates are
scaled in the Poisson model. See \dQuote{Details} for guidance on
the choice of \code{s}.}

\item{numiter}{The number of EM updates performed to compute the
maximum-likelihood estimates of the Poisson model parameters.}

\item{tol}{When \code{tol > 0}, the EM algorithm for computing
maximum-likelihood estimates will be stopped early when the largest
change between two successive updates is less than \code{tol}.}

\item{e}{A small, positive scalar included in some computations to
avoid logarithms of zero and division by zero.}

\item{betamax}{Since the calculation of the standard deviations and
z-scores can be numerically unstable for large LFC estimates,
particularly in large data sets, an upper limit on the estimated
LFC can be used to improve the numerical accuracy of the
calculations.}

\item{shrink.method}{Method used to stabilize the LFC estimates.
When \code{shrink.method = "ash"}, the "adaptive shrinkage" method
implemented in the ashr package is used. When \code{shrink.method =
"none"}, no stabilization is performed, and the \dQuote{raw} LFC
estimates are returned.}

\item{show.warning}{Set \code{show.warning = FALSE} to suppress a
message about calculations when mixture proportions are all 0 or 1.}

\item{verbose}{When \code{verbose = TRUE}, progress information is
printed to the console.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments passed to
\code{diff_count_analysis}.}

\item{cluster}{A factor, or vector that can be converted to a
factor such as an integer or character vector, giving an assignment
of samples (rows of \code{X}) to clusters. This could be, for
example, the "cluster" output from \code{\link[stats]{kmeans}}.}
}
\value{
The return value is a list with six m x k matrices, where m
  is the number of columns in the counts matrix, and k is the number
  of topics (for \code{diff_count_clusters}, m is the number of
  clusters), and an additional vector:

\item{colmeans}{A vector of length m containing the count averages
  (\code{colMeans(X)}).}

\item{F0}{Estimates of the Poisson model parameters \eqn{f_0}.}

\item{F1}{Estimates of the Poisson model parameters \eqn{f_1}.}

\item{beta}{Log-fold change (LFC) estimates. When
  \code{shrink.method = "none"}, these are \code{beta = log2(F1/F0)},
  these are posterior LFC estimates.}

\item{se}{Standard errors for the LFC estimates. When
  \code{shrink.method = "ash"}, these are posterior standard
  errors.}

\item{Z}{LFC z-scores. When \code{shrink.method = "ash"}, these
  are posterior z-scores.}

\item{pval}{-log10 two-tailed p-values computed from the z-scores.}
}
\description{
Implements methods for analysis of differential count
analysis using a topic model. These methods are motivated by gene
expression studies, but could have other uses, such as identifying
\dQuote{key words} in topics derived from text documents. To
improve accuracy of the differential expression analysis, an
empirical Bayes method is used to \dQuote{stabilize} the
estimates. A special case of \dQuote{hard} topic assignments is
also implemented---that is, the mixture proportions are all zeros
and ones---which involves greatly simplified (and faster)
calculations. Use \code{diff_count_clusters} for this special case.
}
\details{
The methods are based on the following univariate
(\dQuote{single-count}) Poisson model: \deqn{x_i ~ Poisson(s_i
\lambda_i),} in which the Poisson rates are defined as
\deqn{\lambda_i = (1 - q_i) f_0 + q_i f_1,} and where the two
unknowns to be estimated are \eqn{f_0, f_1 > 0.} This model is
applied separately to each count (column of the counts matrix), and
to each topic k. The \eqn{q_i}'s are the topic probabilities for a
given topic. An EM algorithm is used to compute maximum-likelihood
estimates (MLEs) of the two unknowns.

The log-fold change (LFC) statistics are defined as the log-ratio
of the two Poisson rate parameters, \eqn{\beta = \log_2(f_1/f_0)}.
This statistic measures the increase (or decrease) in occurence in
one topic compared to all other topics. The use of the base-2
logarithm comes from the convention used in gene expression
studies.

When each \eqn{s_i} (specified by input argument \code{s}) is equal
the total count for sample i (this is the default setting in
\code{diff_count_analysis}), the Poisson model will closely
approximate a binomial model of the count data, so that the Poisson
model parameters \eqn{f_0, f_1} represent binomial probabilities.
In this case, \eqn{\beta} represents the LFC in \emph{relative}
occurrence. (This Poisson approximation to the binomial is most
accurate when the total counts \code{rowSums(X)} are large and
\eqn{f_0, f_1} are small.)

Other choices for \code{s} are possible, and implement different
normalization schemes for the counts, and different interpretations
of the LFC statistics. Setting \code{s} to all ones implements the
differential count analysis with no normalization, and \eqn{\beta}
represents the LFC in \emph{absolute} occurrence. This choice could
be appropriate in settings where the total count is well-controlled
across samples (rows of \code{X}).

The standard error and z-score calculations are based on a Laplace
approximation to the likelihood at the MLE. This is the same
strategy used to compute standard errors and z-scores in
\code{\link[stats]{glm}}.

We recommend setting \code{shrink.method = "ash"}, which uses
"adaptive shrinkage" (Stephens, 2016) to improve accuracy of the
LFC estimates. The improvement in accuracy is greatest for genes
with low expression, or when the sample size is small (or
both). This shrinkage step replicates \code{lfcShrink} from the
DESeq2 package, with \code{type = "ashr"}.
