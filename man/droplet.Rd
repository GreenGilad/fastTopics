\title{Droplet single-cell RNA-seq read count data from Montoro
  \emph{et al} (2018)}
\format{\code{droplet} is a 7,193 x 17,133 sparse matrix of read
counts, with rows corresponding to samples (cells), and columns
corresponding to genes.}
\description{
These data are gene expression profiles of trachea
epithelial cells in C57BL/6 mice obtained using droplet-based 3'
single-cell RNA-seq. They were prepared from file
\code{GSE103354_Trachea_droplet_UMIcounts.txt.gz} downloaded from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website, accession GSE103354.

# Roughly 10\% of the read counts are greater than zero.
